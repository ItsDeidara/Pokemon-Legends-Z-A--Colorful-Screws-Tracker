# Pokémon Legends: Z-A Colorful Screws Tracker

An organized resource for tracking all Colorful Screws in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.  
This tool is linked to the screw location video created by Light 88 and includes map previews of each location, which were scraped using Python and FFmpeg.

## About

I made this tracker after having a hard time finding a good, organized, and fully free way to locate all the screws.  
The tool lets you:

* View screw locations alongside timestamps and map previews  
* Edit notes and timestamps directly on the webpage  
* Export your updated data so you can share or back up your progress  

I manually combed through the video, logged timestamps, and added notes for each screw.  
About 30% of the timestamps are currently complete, with the rest when its not 2am

Currently, 30% of timestamps are complete.
